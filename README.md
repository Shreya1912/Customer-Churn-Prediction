# Customer-Churn-Prediction

• This project predicts the churn and retention for a mobile gaming company using logistic regression which achieved 80% accuracy and then calculates CLV using the estimates.

• The company recently launched a new online community within their latest game. This feature aims to increase player interaction within the game, and management wants to assess the resulting effect on user revenue, retention, and CLV for this game.

• We tested the hypothesis that the new feature increased user revenue, retention, and CLV. We conducted a difference in differences (Diff in Diff) analysis on user revenue using past and present revenue data. We then predicted each user’s retention rate with logistic regression, calculated individual CLV, and tested the differences between customers with a two-sample t-test. Lastly, we formulated a metric, predicting one’s propensity to remain with the game.

• Our analysis showed that the online community increased overall user revenue and CLV, but not user retention. The company should consider leveraging this new feature to incentivize long-term gameplay through stronger bonding between users or facilitating multi-player games.
